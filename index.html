            <p>Hi! My name is Lance Lorenzo, and I'm from Laguna, Philippines. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and
                learning new
                things. I'm currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho through the Pathway program. I've
                always been
                fascinated by how websites work and how design can help people connect, learn, and create. Through this
                course, I hope
                to gain the skills needed to design and build websites that are not only visually appealing but also
                meaningful and
                user-friendly. My goal is to continue improving my abilities so I can use them to serve others and make a
                positive
                impact through technology. </p>

            <img src="images/taytay-falls.jpg" alt="Taytay Falls in Majayjay Laguna">
            <p>Taytay Falls (also known as Imelda Falls) is a beautiful two-tiered waterfall located in Majayjay, Laguna,
                Philippines.
                Surrounded by lush rainforest at the foot of Mount Banahaw, it's known for its crystal-clear, icy-cold water
                and
                peaceful natural setting. The falls cascade into a natural pool perfect for swimming and relaxation, making
                it a
                favorite spot for campers, hikers, and nature lovers seeking a refreshing getaway.</p>
