        <p>Taytay Falls (also known as Imelda Falls) is a beautiful two-tiered waterfall located in Majayjay, Laguna,
            Philippines.
            Surrounded by lush rainforest at the foot of Mount Banahaw, it's known for its crystal-clear, icy-cold water
            and
            peaceful natural setting. The falls cascade into a natural pool perfect for swimming and relaxation, making
            it a
            favorite spot for campers, hikers, and nature lovers seeking a refreshing getaway.</p>
